#  - {name: node_labels, transformation: unit_circle, features_as_channels: True}, use node labels mapped to the 2D unit circle, use features as channels
#  - {name: node_labels, transformation: one_hot, features_as_channels: True}, use node labels and transform them to one-hot encoding
#  - {name: node_features, features_as_channels: True}, use node features as inpu, use features as channels
